# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I also did work for UI response for desktop
If I had more time, I want to show the distance between the hub and my location on modal view once I click the hub on the list of hub
Also, it can show time duration how long does it take the selected hub from my location by using a car, bus, or other vehicles

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

1. I'm most proud of customizing google map. Then I used my own GOOGLE_API_KEY to get position from address
2. I also used SVG icon files, it saves internal memory
3. The UI is responsive for mobile and desktop

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spent most time to build google map add add customized marker
Then, making the UI responsive also took much time

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I finished all work by following the ReadME.md and tested all functions one by one
By using mock data, we can test by using test library
